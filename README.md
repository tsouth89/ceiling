# Win-CodexBar

[Simplified Chinese](./README.zh-CN.md)

Win-CodexBar is a Windows system-tray app for keeping AI coding-tool usage visible without opening a dozen dashboards. It ports the spirit of [CodexBar](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar) to a Tauri + React desktop shell backed by shared Rust provider logic.

## Highlights

- **49 providers** including Codex, Claude, Copilot, OpenRouter, Cursor, Gemini, DeepSeek, MiniMax, Kiro, Antigravity, Groq, and more.
- **Tray-first workflow** with a compact provider grid, usage cards, refresh action, settings shortcut, and quit control.
- **Provider settings** for source selection, credentials, cookie import, token accounts, API keys, regions, and tray-display preferences.
- **Windows credential protection** for app-managed API keys, manual cookies, and token accounts, using user-scoped DPAPI where available.
- **Browser cookie import** for Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Firefox, kept opt-in per provider.
- **Installed local CLI** for scripting usage, cost, config, diagnostics, and loopback integrations.
- **Installer + portable builds** with WebView2 runtime bootstrap, VC++ runtime bootstrap, and SHA-256 checksum files.

## Install

Install with Windows Package Manager:

```powershell
winget install Finesssee.Win-CodexBar
```

Or download the latest installer/portable build from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Finesssee/Win-CodexBar/releases).

- Installer: `CodexBar-<version>-Setup.exe`
- Portable: `CodexBar-<version>-portable.exe`
- Checksums: each release includes `.sha256` files

Winget distribution is approved through [microsoft/winget-pkgs](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/tree/master/manifests/f/Finesssee/Win-CodexBar). New versions can take a little time to appear because every Winget update is pinned to a specific release URL and installer hash.

## First Run

1. Launch **CodexBar** from the Start Menu or portable executable.
2. Click the tray icon to open the usage panel.
3. Open **Settings -> Providers**.
4. Enable the providers you use.
5. Add the matching credential type: OAuth/device login, API key, browser cookies, local CLI login, or token account.

For Claude, browser cookies/sessionKey are preferred because they match Claude's settings-page usage. OAuth and CLI stay available as fallbacks. For CLI-based providers such as Codex and Gemini, sign in with the provider CLI first.

## Latest Release

**v0.33.2** fixes tray-panel dismissal so the popover closes on focus loss or Escape, without immediately reopening from the same tray click.

See the full history in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Build From Source

```powershell
# Prerequisites: Node.js + pnpm. Rust and MinGW are installed by the script when needed.
git clone https://github.com/Finesssee/Win-CodexBar.git
cd Win-CodexBar
.\dev.ps1
```

Useful dev flags:

```powershell
.\dev.ps1 -Release      # optimized build
.\dev.ps1 -SkipBuild    # relaunch the last build
```

CLI examples:

```bash
codexbar --help
codexbar diagnose --pretty
codexbar usage -p claude
codexbar usage -p all
codexbar cost -p codex
```

Installer builds include `codexbar.exe` as the console CLI and `codexbar-desktop.exe` as the tray app. Start Menu shortcuts launch the desktop app; terminal commands use `codexbar.exe`.

## Release Builds

For local Windows release builds, use the cached release builder:

```powershell
.\scripts\windows-release-build.ps1 -Ref v0.33.2 -SmokeInstall
```

The script builds the real Tauri release binary plus the console CLI, verifies signed installer dependencies, packages with Inno Setup, writes installer/portable assets, writes SHA-256 sidecars, and can run a silent install/uninstall smoke test.

More release automation notes live in [docs/release/ci-cd.md](docs/release/ci-cd.md).

## Privacy

- **On-device by default**: provider data is read from known local paths or provider APIs you configure.
- **Opt-in cookies**: browser-cookie extraction only runs for providers you enable.
- **Protected secrets**: API keys, manual cookies, and token accounts use the secure-file layer; Windows uses user-scoped DPAPI where available.
- **Safe diagnostics**: diagnostics expose provider/source/status metadata only, never raw cookies, API keys, bearer tokens, or OAuth values.
- **Verified updates**: installer downloads require a GitHub SHA-256 digest and are re-verified immediately before apply.
