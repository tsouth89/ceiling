# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve Ceiling. Ceiling is a Windows-focused fork with its
own product direction, while preserving useful provider and backend work from
its upstream lineage. Prefer the active Tauri and Rust codepaths over historical
upstream macOS material.

## Active project layout

- `apps\desktop-tauri\` is the default desktop app.
- `apps\desktop-tauri\src\` contains the React frontend.
- `apps\desktop-tauri\src-tauri\src\` contains the Tauri shell, tray bridge, commands, and desktop integration.
- `rust\src\` contains shared backend/domain logic and the standalone `codexbar` CLI.
- `rust\src\providers\` contains provider-specific fetch, auth, and parsing logic.
- `docs\` may include upstream or historical macOS notes. Do not treat those as authoritative for Windows/Tauri work unless the issue is explicitly about upstream parity.

## Before filing an issue

Search existing open and closed issues first. When filing a bug or feature request, use the GitHub issue template and include the affected surfaces, such as tray panel, Settings UI, config file, CLI, installer, or provider-specific behavior.

Do not paste secrets, API keys, cookies, OAuth tokens, private account details, or raw credential files into issues.

## Before opening a PR

Keep PRs focused on one behavior change or fix. Link the issue when one exists, and explain what changed in user-facing terms.

For UI, tray, Settings, or visual behavior changes, include a screenshot, short
recording, or clear manual validation notes. For provider/parser changes,
include deterministic samples or tests where practical.

## Build and test

Run checks that match the code you changed and list the exact commands in the PR.

Common commands from the repo root:

```powershell
cargo test --manifest-path rust\Cargo.toml
cargo test --manifest-path apps\desktop-tauri\src-tauri\Cargo.toml
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --manifest-path rust\Cargo.toml --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo clippy --manifest-path apps\desktop-tauri\src-tauri\Cargo.toml --all-targets -- -D warnings
pnpm --dir apps\desktop-tauri test
pnpm --dir apps\desktop-tauri run build
```

Build the desktop shell through Tauri:

```powershell
pnpm --dir apps\desktop-tauri tauri:build
```

Raw `cargo build --release` for the Tauri crate is not the preferred desktop build because it can still point at the dev URL.

## Coding expectations

- Keep provider-specific logic inside the provider module when possible.
- Route new provider construction through `codexbar::core::instantiate_provider`.
- Keep settings and ordering behavior in shared Rust when it is cross-surface state.
- Use existing helpers instead of adding near-duplicate logic.
- Avoid logging or storing raw secrets.
- Add focused tests near the changed code.
- Keep UI behavior accessible; do not rely only on brittle drag/drop when a button or keyboard path is needed.
- For UI/tray flows, include visual or manual proof, especially when interaction reliability matters.

## Release and packaging changes

Installer, Winget, and release workflow changes need extra care. Verify release URLs, installer hashes, and packaging behavior before opening a PR that changes release artifacts or manifests.
