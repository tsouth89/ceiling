 * answers it — a reading going stale or a provider erroring underneath does not
 * pull the card out from under a click that is already on its way.
 *
 * The ask is counted when the card first appears, not when it is answered, so a
 * user who closes the window without touching it has still had their first ask.
 * Anything else would let the same prompt come back every launch, which is the
 * behaviour this whole feature is trying not to have.
